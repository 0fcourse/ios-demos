# AR Image Detection Workshop 

In this workshop we will build a AR app that uses Image Detection API. 

The repository contains the SOLID novoda postcards as Image to be detected, but those could be substitue for any images you want to use. 

The repository also contains a Status Controller and a Session extension that basiclaly gives feedback on the user on the status of recognizing the enviroment. This allows ofr a better experience. 

If you want to see the complete project you can check out [AR Solid Cards Recognition](https://github.com/novoda/ios-demos/tree/mvvm-example/ARSolidCardsRecognition) project with all the working code
