# AdaptiveCK

This demo is not a full application but simply shows different stages of getting a sample screen design to behave adaptively. It is part of a Hack & Tell I gave on adaptive iOS design. See [linked pdf](https://github.com/novoda/ios-demos/blob/master/Adaptive%20iOS%20Design/Adaptive%20iOS%20Design.pdf) for the H&T slides.
