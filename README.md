This is a collection of basic iOS examples created by Novoda. Most recent at the top.

* [Adaptive iOS Design]()
This demo is not a full application but simply shows different stages of getting a sample screen design to behave adaptively. It is part of a Hack & Tell I gave on adaptive iOS design. See [linked pdf](https://github.com/novoda/ios-demos/blob/master/Adaptive%20iOS%20Design/Adaptive%20iOS%20Design.pdf) for the H&T slides.

* [Kaleidoscope (no tests)](https://github.com/novoda/ios-demos/tree/master/Kaleidoscope%20(no%20tests))
A simulated kaleidoscope. It follows the standard MVC pattern but uses no reactive programming. It also has no tests. I'm planning to rewrite it from scratch strictly following TDD to see what the differences are.

* [Calculator - Your First iOS App](https://github.com/novoda/ios-demos/tree/master/Your%20First%20iOS%20App)
A very simple calculator app, with just enough interesting bits to give an idea of what an iOS app looks like from a developer's point of view. No, it has no error checking or unit tests, and doesn't follow the MVC pattern the way it should, but it's a start.
