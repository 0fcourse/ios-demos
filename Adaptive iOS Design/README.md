# AdaptiveCK

This demo is not a full application but simply shows different stages of getting a sample screen design to behave adaptively. It is part of a [Hack & Tell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iI4PmsjYW3Y&index=1&list=PLsAfcuwrBov7UYpOrN8ez7Y0e-O38bOoa) I gave on adaptive iOS design. See [linked pdf](https://github.com/novoda/ios-demos/blob/master/Adaptive%20iOS%20Design/Adaptive%20iOS%20Design.pdf) for the H&T slides.
