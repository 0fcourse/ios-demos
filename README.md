# Your First iOS App

This demo builds a very simple calculator app. It's not an example to be followed in terms of architecture since it doesn't follow the MVC pattern the way it's supposed to and it also does not do much error checking, nor does it have any unit tests.

Rather, it's an app built during a Hack-and-Tell just to get Novoda's Android developers minimally acquainted with Xcode and with some of the main ideas behind building an iOS app.
