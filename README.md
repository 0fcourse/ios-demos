This is a collection of basic iOS examples created by Novoda.

* [Calculator - Your First iOS App](https://github.com/novoda/ios-demos/tree/master/Your%20First%20iOS%20App)
A very simple calculator app, with just enough interesting bits to give an idea of what an iOS app looks like from a developer's point of view. No, it has no error checking or unit tests, and doesn't follow the MVC pattern the way it should, but it's a start.
