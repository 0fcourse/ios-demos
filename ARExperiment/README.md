# ARExperiment

This is a simple demo app that pairs with our investigation into ARKIT

* `OneModelUsingAnchorsViewController` Adds one 3D model to the scene using `ARAnchors` method described on the [Getting started with ARKit](https://www.novoda.com/blog/getting-started-with-arkit/) blog post
* `OneModelUsingVectorsViewController` Adds one 3D model to the scene using `SCNNodes` and `planeDetection` method described on the [Getting started with ARKit](https://www.novoda.com/blog/getting-started-with-arkit/) blog post
* `SizeComparisonViewController` Adds 3 different sized cubes to the `sceneView` to check how big cm are in the AR world
* `RecognizeObjectsViewController` Adds a 3D model to the scene using CoreML to recognise where to place the model. You can read more on the Machine Learning part in the [Making AR more precise with CoreML](https://www.novoda.com/blog/arkit-coreml/)
* `LightsAnimationsViewController` Adds one 3D model to the scene using `ARAnchors` and allowing for animations, lights and shadows to be imported from the model
